\subsection{Custom Events and Commands}

As has been stated at various points, the main restriction of the current
debugger is strict adherence to the confines of the Debug Adapter Protocol.

library used in Gillian and the debugger extension API in Visual Studio Code
support the use of custom commands and extensions%
~\cite{ocaml-dap-custom, vscode-dap-custom-event, vscode-dap-custom-request}, as
outlined in \autoref{sec:vscode}.
