\chapter{Evaluation plan}
\label{cha:eval}

Surpassing Gillian as it currently stands largely equates to completing the
core goals set out in the project plan. With a reasonable effort, this project
will make a tangible difference to Gillian's usability.

When considering to related work, a primary point of comparison is VeriFast, as
it also implements a debugger for full program verification. Gillian's
debugging capabilities have already caught up tremendously with VeriFast, so
this project should give the former an ample opportunity to overtake the latter.
After completion of the project, Gillian's standing with VeriFast will be
reassessed.

Of particular interest to Professor Gardner is bringing Gillian to a position
where it can be used as part of her course on separation logic, taught at
Imperial College London~\cite{sl-course}. Using Gillian for educational
purposes could be a good stepping stone to bringing it to developers in
industry; whether or not it can serve this purpose is down to how Garder, and
potentially some student testers, find the debuggers capabilities and
usability, once the project is completed.
