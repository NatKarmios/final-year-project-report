  abstract = {VeriFast is a prototype verification tool for single-threaded and multithreaded C and Java programs. In this paper, we first describe the basic symbolic execution approach in some formal detail. Then we zoom in on two technical aspects: the approach to permission accounting, including fractional permissions, precise predicates, and counting permissions; and the approach to lemma function termination in the presence of dynamically-bound lemma function calls. Finally, we describe three ongoing efforts: application to JavaCard programs, integration of shape analysis, and application to Linux device drivers.},
